## Results:
Some important things to note about June in Oahu and December in Oahu are:
- the minimum temperature is much lower in December (56 degrees) than in June (64 degrees)
- the standard deviation of temperature is higher in December (3.75) than in June (3.26)
- the average temperature stays roughly the same, being within 4 degrees.

## Analysis
While it makes sense that the minimum temperature would drastically drop in the winter, the average temperature remained above 70 degrees. This leads us to believe that
maintaining service would be possible on select days in the winter months, although according to the histograms, December sees a disproportionate amount of cold days compared
to the even distribution that June sees.
